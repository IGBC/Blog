# My Personal Blog
This is the storage repo for my blog which is hosted at https://sigsegv.tech It is 
built using Pelican, a python based blogging engine, and uses markdown to store it's 
articles. 

### Why is it on Github & Gitlab?
Firstly the depth of research needed to write some of the existing articles consist 
sometimes of up to a week of free time, I wanted that time commitment to be reflected 
on the github public contribution counter. 

Secondly it allows my readers to interact with my blog by posting issues if they find 
a content issue, or want to suggest an article.

Finally it exposes my "Editorial" branch allowing my readers to see a sneek peek of 
what is comming up.
