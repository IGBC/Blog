title: Stellaris is Better than ever; and that's a problem.

Stellaris is a 4X like galactic level RTS released in 2016 by Paradox Interactive. The game was received by a mostly positive audience, and commended for continuing Paradox's tenancy to release titles with day one Linux support. To me the game had a flair I had not seen since childhood, making this game feel like close a spiritual successor to Galactic Civilizations II (Also published by Paradox).

But like any product Stellaris is not without problems. Stellaris is one of the most bug-free games I have ever played, and in 50 hours of game-play it has not crashed on me. Not once, not ever. (Are you listening Squad, makers of Kerbal Space Program?) Stellaris' main problem was that it was *hard*. The game actively rewards micro-managing your entire galactic empire, and the mechanics at launch promoted smash and dash combat. None of this is new, but unlike it's predecessors this game is played in real time. It was common as a new player to get frustrated when you're attacked in the middle of managing your internal politics, and loose everything for not having a careful eye on the border.

With all of the above said, the game was rewarding and deeply engaging. I found that the loss of an entire empire with loosing the game, was a deterent to starting a new match immediately, but that's very much a personal problem. 

So Stellaris 2016 (Reviewed 2017) ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️, Would recommend if you're willing to put down the money for this very expensive game.

Yea... It's not 2017 anymore, and this article is not over. We've got a problem to talk about.

If you haven't bought Stellaris yet and are looking for an up to date and honest review here's the TLDR:

> *"Stellaris in 2018 is a unique and innovative RTS experience. The game has been 'lovingly' re-balanced over the last two years to create a challenging but fair flow. The game's story engine has also received attention, adding a natural, and immersive story to every play through of the game. Unfortunately Paradox have gone a little DLC-Mad in the last few years with this game and others. While most of the content packs are irrelevant to new players and not having them will not remove from the game-play, I would consider "Stellaris: Utopia" and "Stellaris: Leviathans Story Pack" vital to getting the full game experience. This brings the total cost to €70 (European region at time of review) At this price it is still a rewarding game, and highly recommended."* - My review of Stellaris on Steam.

Did you pick up the hint of discourse in there?

> *"...'lovingly' re-balanced..."*

> *"...content packs are irrelevant..."*

Yea this game is a hatchet job at this point!

So shit it's the fan first with "Stellaris: Synthetic Dawn" which released mere months after the greatly hyped Utopia expansion. Synthetic Dawn does not actually add that much content, but many players were left asking "why wasn't this included in Utopia". This was followed by two more small and entirely underwhelming content packs, that where purely cosmetic. This left me with the strong impression that the game was not selling as well as hoped. Valve do not publish sales numbers for individual games but a [source](https://steamdb.info/app/281990/graphs/) suggests between 1 and 2 million users have this game in their library (at time of writing). 

The real problems however started in 2018 with the release of "Stellaris: Apocalypse". Apocalypse was hyped up as the second major expansion to Stellaris, with major additions to game-play, and a completely new experience. What we all got was major **changes** to game-play and a familiar but distinct difference. And when I say "we all" I mean everyone. Even if you didn't buy Apocalypse!

See Stellaris can be played as a local or online multiplayer game. So ever since Leviathans they have released an update with each expansion to keep everyone playing essentially the same game. This has the marketable side effect of the base game getting mild feature creep from the expansions, which is nice. As the game never really changed much, and game updates are a regular occurrence on the Steam platform, no one cared, and I didn't even notice. 

Then the apocalypse happened! I will quote the change log from official wiki, maintained by Paradox:
> Patch 2.0, aka “Cherryh”, was released on 2018-02-22 with the checksum daf0. The patch was released alongside the Apocalypse expansion pack. 
>
> DESIGNERS' NOTE
> 
> Stellaris has changed quite dramatically for 2.0, and in our experience, for the better. Overall you can expect the game-play to have been slowed down a little, and you now need to make active decisions on which star systems you want to expand into and control. 
> 
> [...]
> 
> How you use your fleets will be different as well, [...]
> 
> The war system has changed as well, [...]
> 
> We hope you are ready for the Apocalypse. 

Yeah, they actually stuck a warning in their change log.

To maintain compatibility Paradox where forced to push all of their hyped up changes into the base game. This:

 1. Pissed off everyone excited to buy Apocalypse, because the expansion pack was reduced to adding a few late game toys that really weren't very fun to play with.
 2. Pissed off everyone not wanting to buy Apocalypse, because the changes deeply effected basic mechanics of the game, and permanently changed the way it is played.
 
Honestly speaking I enjoy the new changes. They have really brought out the best in what was already there. But the cost for this is removed content. Stellaris 1.2 (where I started playing) had 3 modes of travel. It added depth to play as not evey empire expanded in the same way. In apocalypse there is one. Friggin space lanes! This fixed lots of balance issues, but leaves a bitter aftertaste of having content removed from a game **I already bought.**

Ultimately this is not the product I paid for; that leaves me feeling cheated by Paradox, but also by steam. There are a lot of better ways they could have handled this compatibility change. For example a "2.0 Upgrade DLC" that is free to all players, but at least I can toggle on and off in the Steam DLC menu, or heck an in game button for it. But both of those options are Paradox's responsibility. In the end it's Paradox's game, they can do whatever the hell they like with it. 

##### Actually it's Valve's fault!

Steam update is a mostly positive feature, with the intent of always keeping your game ready to play. There is however a dark side to it. Steam will only ever let you access the latest version of a game*, so it is entirely possible for a developer to poison a game. Possibilities include:

 * Removing content and re-adding it as a DLC 
 * Forcibly updating a game to contain some form of malware or add-ware
 * Even bricking the game completely. 

Valve do not require game developers to submit updates for audit before pushing them to customers, so all of the above are easily possible. The only thing preventing this foul play is that most game companies don't want to risk the reputation over it. 

But it's proven repeatedly that publisher reputation doesn't really effect video game sales. (See Battlefront 2 - 2017) and with that it's a matter of time before someone decides boosting sales of a sequel is worth bricking it's predecessor. It's up to us as consumers to put pressure on Valve (and other platforms) to allow us to download whatever version of a game we want. Rationale for this builds when you factor in early access titles, that can quickly suffer a painful death, and the modding community, which has a careful game of version leapfrog it has to play. 

**Demand access to every version of the product you paid for!**

As for poor old Stellaris 2.0, well I guess I have no choice but to love you, or go back to playing Galactic Civilizations II. But in my heart I will always feel that Paradox should have put more scope and grandeur into Apocalypse, merged it with a shader update, and shipped it as Stellaris II... and I guess charged me another 40 bucks for it...
