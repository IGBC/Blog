This blog documents the ramblings of Segfault, an electronic engineer from Berlin.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Segfault works commercially as an electronic engineer, designing industrial control hardware / firmware for imaging equipment. He however identifies more as a hacker, university dropout, and general activist for equality. Segfault has been known before to describe himself as "creatively insane"; nothing evidences this better than the fact that this page is written in the 3rd passive voice. Sane people don't write about themselves in the third person, do they?

In his free time Segfault divides his efforts between hardware and software projects. He is reasonably fond of C, Python, and cursing; he does not like web development. His interests spread into most things techy, including video games, PC hardware, Computer architecture, electronics, reverse engineering... I could go on. More recently Segfault has taken interest in combining technology into art forms as inspired by Micah Scott [misc.name](https://www.misc.name).

However Segfault primarily enjoys coming up with crazy ideas, then forgetting or abandoning them before actually being able to do anything with them. As a result this blog was created as a place to write down random thoughts and rants (sorry there will be rants) before they too were forgotten. It also documents the current progress of projects not forgotten.
