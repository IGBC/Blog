### Optimising the fun out of games...
So I don't like admitting this, but I have been playing one of those cheaply produced android shovel ware games. [This](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sm.calculateme) one caught my attention from the myriad of games on the app store because it was a calculator game. As a self described "serious geek" I couldn't help but check it out, so I installed it.

The game was OK, I guess. The fun wore off quickly and around level 15 I found myself stuck and bored with the game. I started jabbing combinations of buttons at random, and while idly clicking I had a realisation. The level had 3 possible buttons and was limited to 3 moves; I could easily brute force this! I started writing out the possible move combinations on the back of my sandwich wrapper. [See the full blog article on this for more!]({filename}/Blog/2019-02-10_Optimising the fun out of games.md)
